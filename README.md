Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
Software Engineer is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, implentation and maintenance of complex computer programs.
The importance of Software Engineer is to allow for the production of very powerful, and reliable software in a more efficient way.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.
1970s: A number of new methodologies are developed, including structured programming and object-oriented programming.
1980s: The first computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are released


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
Requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
Waterfall is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the nextone while Agile is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experimenting with direction and don't know how the final project will look before they start.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools
A Quality Assurance Engineer Design test plans, scenarios, scripts, as well as dentify, analyze, and document problems with program function, output, online screen, or content.
A project Manager lisises between the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
IDEs assist in streamlining development process therby enabling faster iteration and delivery of features.
Examples are NetBeans, Eclipse, Intellij, and Visual Studio.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
An example of challenge a software engineers faces is that Technology eveolves at a phenomenal rate and that leads to added pressure for software engineers.
The strategy to manage this is by staying up to date on concepts such as stack and JavaScript to writing codes gives them the cutting edge over competitors and allow them to stand out in a highly competitive market.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:
Unit tests, Integration tests, Functional tests, End-to-end tests, Acceptance testing, Performance testing, Smoke testing.
QA testing ensures the product you deliver to your users, meets necessary quality, reliability, and security requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer:
Prompt Engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model.
It's importance makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
It also helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models' training data.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
Tell me everything about
How may I assist you?                 
Improved Prompt is more effective because it helps to bridgeg the gap between their current skill level and the level you are hoping to reach.
